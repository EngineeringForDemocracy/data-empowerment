## R Markdown

R Markdown is a flexible type of document that allows you to seamlessly
combine executable R code (and its output) with text and images in a
single document. These documents can be readily converted to multiple
static and dynamic output formats, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx),
and HTML (.html).

The benefit of a well-prepared R Markdown document is full
reproducibility! This also means that, if you notice a data
transcription error or you are able to add more data to your analysis,
you will be able to recompile the report without making any changes in
the actual document.

The **rmarkdown** package comes pre-installed with RStudio, so no action
is necessary to begin using R Markdown documents.

## Creating an R Markdown File

To create a new R Markdown document in RStudio, click File -\> New File
-\> R Markdown:

![](fig/new-rmd.png){alt="Screenshot of the New R Markdown file dialogue box in RStudio"}

Then, click on 'Create Empty Document' to generate your R Markdown file.

In practice, you can enter the title of your document, your name
(Author), and select the type of output. However, in this lesson, we
will be learning how to start from a blank document.

## Basic Components of R Markdown

To control the output, a YAML header is needed. YAML (which stands for
YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a human-readable serialization language
that helps with the configuration of files!

An example of a YAML header can be seen below:

```         
---
title: "My Awesome Report"
author: "Emmet Brickowski"
date: ""
output: html_document
---
```

In R Markdown, the header is defined by the three hyphens at the
beginning (`---`) and the three hyphens at the end (`---`).

Within this header, the only required field is the `output`, which
specifies the type of output you want. This can be an `html_document`, a
`pdf_document`, or a `word_document`. We will start with an HTML
document and discuss the other options later.

Since the other fields are not required, you can delete them if they are
unneeded!

To begin the body of your document, start typing after the end of the
YAML header (i.e. after the second `---`).

## Markdown Syntax

Markdown is a popular markup language that allows you to add formatting
elements to text, such as **bold**, *italics*, and `code`. However, the
formatting will not be immediately visible in your markdown (.md)
document, like you would see in a Word document. Rather, Markdown syntax
applied to text within your file is converted into formatted elements
*upon output*. Markdown is useful because it is lightweight, flexible, and
platform independent.

Some platforms provide a real time preview of the formatting, like
RStudio's visual markdown editor (available from version 1.4).

First, let's create a heading! A `#` in front of text indicates to
Markdown that this text is a heading. Adding more `#`s make the heading
smaller, i.e. one `#` is a first level heading, two `##`s is a second
level heading, etc. This can be repeated up until the 6th level heading.

```         
# Title
## Section
### Sub-section
#### Sub-sub section
##### Sub-sub-sub section
###### Sub-sub-sub-sub section
```

Please note that you should only use a level if the one above it is also
in use! For example, you should not create a header using `####` unless
headers at `###` and *all* higher levels are present earlier in the
document.

Since we have already defined our title in the YAML header, we will use
a section heading to create an Introduction section.

```         
## Introduction
```

You can make things **bold** by surrounding the word with double
asterisks, `**bold**`, or double underscores, `__bold__`. *Italics* can
be applied using single asterisks, `*italics*`, or single underscores,
`_italics_`.

You can also combine **bold** and *italics* to write something
***really*** important with triple-asterisks, `***really***`, or
underscores, `___really___`. If you're feeling bold (pun intended), you
can also use a combination of asterisks and underscores, `**_really_**`,
`*__really__*`.

To create `code-type` font, surround the word with back-ticks,
`` `code-type` ``.

Now, let's apply everything we've learned about markdown syntax thus
far:

```         
## Introduction

This report uses the **tidyverse** package along with the *Check-In* Dataset, 
which has columns that include:
```

Then we can create a list for the variables using `-`, `+`, or `*` keys.

```         
## Introduction

This report uses the **tidyverse** package along with the *Check-In* Dataset, 
which has columns that include:

- checkin\_id
- checkin\_length
- checkin\_time
- location
- precinct
- device 
```

You can also create an ordered list using numbers:

```         
1. checkin\_id
2 checkin\_length
3. checkin\_time
4. location
5. precinct
6. device
```

And nested items by tab-indenting:

```         
- checkin\_id
  + Unique key/ID for each ballot instance
- checkin\_length
  + Number of seconds it took for the person submitting the ballot to check-in
- checkin\_time
  + Arrival time of the person submitting the ballot
- location
  + Anonymized ID for the location of the ballot box
- precinct
  + Anonymized ID for the precinct that the ballot box belongs to
- device
  + Anonymized ID for each ballot box
```

For more Markdown syntax see [the following reference
guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax).

To render your document into HTML, click the **Knit** button at the top
of the Source panel (top left), or use the keyboard shortcut
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> for Windows and Linux or
<kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> for Mac. If you haven't
saved the document yet, you will be prompted to do so when you **Knit**
for the first time.

![](fig/rmd-rmd_to_html.png){alt="The 'knitting' process: First, R Markdown is converted to Markdown, which is then converted (via pandoc) to .html, .pdf, .docx, etc."}

## Writing an R Markdown Report

Next, we will add some R code from our previous data wrangling and
visualization, which means we need to make sure **tidyverse** is loaded.
However, it is no longer enough to just load **tidyverse** from the console
-- when working with R Markdown, you must ensure any necessary packages
are loaded within the document itself. The same applies to our data. To
do so, we will need to create a 'code chunk' at the top of our document
(below the YAML header).

A code chunk can be inserted by clicking Code -\> Insert Chunk, or by
using the keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>
for Windows and Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>I</kbd>
for Mac.

The syntax of a code chunk is:

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r chunk-name}
"This is where you would place your R code!"
```
````

An R Markdown document knows that this text is not part of the report
from the
```` ``` ```` 
that begins and ends the chunk. It also knows that the code inside of
the chunk is written in R from the `r` inside of the curly braces
(`{}`). After the `r`, you can add a name for the code chunk. Naming a
chunk is optional, but recommended for organizational purposes. When
naming chunks, each chunk name must be unique, and only contain
alphanumeric characters and `-`.

```{r package-data, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
data <- read_csv(here("data", "checkin_data.csv"))
```

To load **tidyverse** and our `checkin_data.csv` file, we will insert
a chunk and call it 'setup'. Since we don't want this code or the output
to show in our knitted HTML document, we add an `include = FALSE` option
after the code chunk name (`{r setup, include = FALSE}`).

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r setup, include = FALSE}
#loads in the tidyverse and here packages
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

#reads in data and assigns it to the 'data' variable using 'here'
data <- read_csv(here("data", "checkin_data.csv"))
```
````

::: callout
## Important Note!

The file paths you give in a .Rmd document, e.g. to load a .csv file,
are relative to the .Rmd document, **not** the project root.

As suggested in the Starting with Data episode, we highly recommend the
use of the `here()` function to keep the file paths consistent within
your project.
:::

## Insert Table

Next, we will re-create a table from the Data Wrangling episode which
shows the total number of check-ins grouped by `precinct`. We can do
this by creating a new code chunk and calling it 'anon-tbl'. Alternatively, 
you can come up with something more creative (just remember to stick to the
naming rules).

When writing code chunks, unlike text, it isn't necessary to **Knit** your 
document every time you want to see the output. Instead you can run the code chunk 
with the green triangle in the top right corner of the the chunk, or by using the 
keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> for Windows and
Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> for Mac.

To make sure the table is formatted nicely in our output document, we
will need to use the `kable()` function from the **knitr** package. The
`kable()` function takes the output of your R code and knits it into a
nice looking HTML table. You can also specify different aspects of the
table (i.e., the column names or the caption).

Run the code chunk below to ensure you get the desired output:
```{r anon-tbl, message=FALSE, purl=FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(precinct) %>%
  summarize(total_checkins = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_checkins)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "We can also add a caption.", 
               col.names = c("Precinct", 
                             "Total Check-Ins"))
```

Many different R packages can be used to generate tables. Some of the
more commonly used options are listed in the table below:

## Customizing Chunk Output

Earlier, we mentioned using `include = FALSE` in a code chunk to prevent the code 
and output from printing in the knitted document. There are additional options 
available to customize how the code-chunks are presented in the output document. 
The options are entered in the code chunk after `chunk-name` and separated by 
commas, e.g. `{r chunk-name, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}`.

| Option | Options | Output |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `eval` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Whether or not the code within the code chunk should be run. |
| `echo` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Choose if you want to show your code chunk in the output document. `echo = TRUE` will show the code chunk. |
| `include` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Choose if the output of a code chunk should be included in the document. `FALSE` means that your code will run, but will not show up in the document. |
| `warning` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Whether or not you want your output document to display potential warning messages produced by your code. |
| `message` | `TRUE` or `FALSE` | Whether or not you want your output document to display potential messages produced by your code. |
| `fig.align` | `default`, `left`, `right`, `center` | Where the figure from your R code chunk should be output on the page |

::: callout
## Tip
-   The default settings for the above chunk options are all `TRUE`.
-   The default settings can be modified per chunk, or with
    `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` (i.e., entering
    `knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)` will change the default of
    value of `echo` to `FALSE` for **every** code chunk in the
    document).
:::

:::: challenge
## Exercise
Play around with the different options in the chunk with the code for the table, 
and re-**Knit** to see what each option does to the output.

What happens if you use `eval = FALSE` and `echo = FALSE`? What is the difference 
between this and `include = FALSE`?

::: solution
## Solution to Exercise

Chunk 1:
````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(precinct) %>%
  summarize(total_checkins = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_checkins)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "We can also add a caption.", 
               col.names = c("Precinct", 
                             "Total Check-Ins"))
```
````

Chunk 2:
````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r include = FALSE}
data %>%
  group_by(precinct) %>%
  summarize(total_checkins = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_checkins)) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "We can also add a caption.", 
               col.names = c("Precinct", 
                             "Total Check-Ins"))
```
````

-   `eval = FALSE` and `echo = FALSE` will neither run the code in the chunk, nor 
    show the code in the knitted document. The code chunk essentially doesn't 
    exist in the knitted document!
-   `include = FALSE` will not display the code nor the output, but it *will* be 
    ran, with the output stored for later use!
:::

::::

## In-Line R Code

Now we will use some in-line R code to present some descriptive statistics. To 
use in-line R-code, we use the same back-ticks that we used in the Markdown section, 
with an `r` to specify that we are generating R-code. The difference between 
in-line code and a code chunk is the number of back-ticks. In-line R code uses 
one back-tick (`` `r` ``), whereas code chunks use three back-ticks 
(```` ```r``` ````).

For example, today's date is ``` ``r "r Sys.Date()"`` ```, will be rendered as: 
today's date is `r Sys.Date()`. The code will display today's date in the output 
document (or, technically, the date the document was last knitted).

The best way to use in-line R code is by preparing the output in code chunks, 
minimizing the code needed to produce the output. For example, let's say we're 
interested in presenting the total check-ins for a specific precinct.

We can run the below code to create the total_2866 object, making future in-line 
R code much easier to write:
```{r in-line-code, purl=FALSE}
#create a summary tibble with the total check-ins per precinct
df <- data %>%
      group_by(precinct) %>%
      summarize(total_checkins = n())

#select the precinct we want to use
total_2866 <- df %>%
              filter(precinct == "2866")
```

Now we can make an informative statement on the counts of each precinct,
and include the total values as in-line R-code. For example:

The total check-ins at precinct 2866 is ``` ``r "r total_2866$total_checkins"`` ```

becomes...

The total check-ins at precinct 2866 is `r total_2866$total_checkins`.

Because we are using in-line R code instead of the actual values, we
have created a dynamic document that will automatically update if we
make changes to the data set and/or code chunks.

## Plots

Finally, our last addition to our document will be a plot from the Data Visualization 
lesson!

:::: challenge
## Exercise

Create a new code chunk for the plot, and copy the code from any of the
plots we created in the previous episode to produce a plot in the chunk.

If you are feeling adventurous, you can also create a new plot using the
`data` tibble.

::: solution
## Solution to Exercise

```{r my-fancy-plot, answer=TRUE, purl=FALSE}
#retrieve top devices
top_devices <- data %>%
  count(device) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  pull(device)

#create plot
data %>%
  filter(device %in% top_devices) %>%
  mutate(device = str_remove(device, "DEVICE_")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = device, fill = device)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Devices by Number of Check-ins",
       x = "Device",
       y = "Count")+
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```
:::
::::

We can also create a caption with the chunk option `fig.cap`.

````{verbatim, lang = "markdown"}
```{r chunk-name, fig.cap = "I made this plot while attending an
awesome workshop where I learned a ton of cool stuff!"}
"Insert the code for the plot here"
```
````

...or, ideally, something more informative.

```{r caption-plot, eval=TRUE, fig.cap="I made this plot while attending an awesome workshop where I learned a ton of cool stuff!"}
#retrieve top devices
top_devices <- data %>%
  count(device) %>%
  top_n(10, n) %>%
  pull(device)

#create plot
data %>%
  filter(device %in% top_devices) %>%
  mutate(device = str_remove(device, "DEVICE_")) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = device, fill = device)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Top 10 Devices by Number of Check-ins",
       x = "Device",
       y = "Count")+
  theme_classic() + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

## Other Output Options

To convert an R Markdown file to a PDF or Word Document, you can either click the 
little triangle next to the **Knit** button to get a drop-down menu or put 
`pdf_document` or `word_document` in the initial header of the file.

For example, to output to a `word_document`:
```         
---
title: "My Awesome Report"
author: "Emmet Brickowski"
date: ""
output: word_document
---
```

::: callout
## Note: Creating PDF Documents

Creating .pdf documents may require installation of some extra software.
The R package `tinytex` provides some tools to help make this process
easier for R users. With `tinytex` installed, run
`tinytex::install_tinytex()` to install the required software (you'll
only need to do this once) and then when you **Knit** to pdf `tinytex`
will automatically detect and install any additional LaTeX packages that
are needed to produce the pdf document. For more information, visit the
[tinytex website](https://yihui.org/tinytex/).

## Note: Inserting Citations into an R Markdown File

It is possible to insert citations into an R Markdown file using the
editor toolbar. The editor toolbar includes commonly seen formatting
buttons generally seen in text editors (e.g., bold and italic buttons) 
and is accessible by using the settings drop-down menu (next to
the 'Knit' drop-down menu) to select 'Use Visual Editor'. You can also use the 
keyboard shortcuts <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> for Windows and
Linux or <kbd>Cmd</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F4</kbd> for Mac. From here, clicking
'Insert' allows 'Citation' to be selected.

Using this menu, you can search various sources for citations and insert the 
appropriate citation necessary. For example, searching
'10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4' in 'From DOI' and inserting will provide the
citation for `ggplot2` [@wickham2016]. This will also save the
citation(s) in 'references.bib' in the current working directory. Visit
the [R Studio
website](https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/) for more
information. 

Additionally, you can obtain citation information from relevant packages 
by using `citation("package")`.
